--------

[```sgolayfilt```](https://github.com/AlexHenderson/sgolayfilt/blob/master/sgolayfilt.m) is a replacement for Matlab's [```sgolay```](http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/sgolay.html) function that just calculates and returns the differentiation filters. The result is 2&ndash;4 times faster.

```sgolayfilt(K,F)``` returns the matrix of differentiation filters. The polynomial order, ```K```, must be a integer less than window size, ```F```, which must be an odd integer. If the polynomial order, ```K```, equals ```F-1```, no smoothing will occur. Each of the ```K+1``` columns of the output is a differentiation filter for derivatives of order ```P-1``` where ```P``` is the column index.

This fork of the original code from Andrew Horchler replaces the error messages with exceptions. There is no change to the functional aspect of the code.
